# OpenIPMI
Software &amp; Hardware that emulates server IPMI, Out-of-band management, but for Desktops Laptops &amp; other form factors! Uses SBC like a Raspberry Pi, and a "FPGA Hat" to capture the Display, simulate inputs, and even mount a virtual USB Drive from GPIO headers &amp; FPGA!

Software IPMI Emulator should be 100% compatible with Bare Metal Managers like Foreman & MAAS! Letting you configure & install any computer autonomously!

Power can be controlled using a "Smart Power-distribution-unit" or outlet with a Relay & Arduino.
